### **QuickTodos: A Simple and Collaborative Todo List Application**

---

### **1. Product Objective and Description**

**QuickTodos** is a Todo List application that allows users to create and manage personal task lists within rooms accessible via a shared URL. Each user can create a todo list tied to a specific room, which can be accessed by anyone with the URL. Users can add, delete, and organize their tasks simply through a drag-and-drop system.

This application is designed for team collaboration without the need for login or registration. Each room has a unique URL that can be shared to access and collaborate on the task list.
